        <p style= "color:rgb(240, 73, 12)"> Hi! I am <b>Diana Rose Torres Duot </b>, you can call me "Yan" or "D" for short. 
            <br> I have a Bachelor Degree in Accounting Technology at Holy Cross of Davao College last April 2018.
            <br> After graduation, I worked right away to make money and help my parents with our expenses. 
            <br> I've been in different industries before like BPO, shipping companies and also in a government office. 
            <br> With those experiences, I have a gain a lot of skills, knowledge and build my character towards work. 
            <br> Now, my goal is to search for a rewarding career where I can grow and develop professionally. </p>
    
        <p style= "color:rgb(240, 73, 12)"> As I resigned from my recent work, I was actively job searching and came across a video on Facebook of a student in Kodego.
            <br> I was deeply resonated with her as I also experience not having a secure job and came to the point where I am already questioning my self-worth. 
            <br> I came to realize that I shouldn't waste my time blaming myself and the opportunities I had. 
            <br> Rather, I took action and remind myself that everything will get better in time. </p>


        <p style= "color:rgb(240, 73, 12)">Now, I am currently taking Web Development course in Kodego. I find this very interesting and challenging as this requires a lot of determination and curiosity. 
        <br> Provided with this opportunity, I can start an in-demand career in tech industry. Hopefully after this bootcamp, I am able to work with clients and somehow become a successful .</p>
